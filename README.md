## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Credit_Risk-_System
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Preprocessing
```bash
python src/preprocessing.py
```
> Outputs: scaled train/test arrays + `scaler.pkl` in `models/`

### 4. Train Models
```bash
python src/training.py
```
> Outputs: `logistic_regression.pkl`, `decision_tree.pkl`, `metrics.json`, confusion matrix & feature plots in `models/`

### 5. Launch Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```
> Opens at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🤖 Models Used
| Model | Role | Key Parameters | Accuracy | ROC-AUC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Logistic Regression** | Primary | `max_iter=1000` | **89.7%** | **0.953** |
| **Decision Tree** | Secondary | `max_depth=6`, `min_samples_leaf=50` | **91.6%** | **0.960** |

Both models are evaluated on **Accuracy**, **ROC-AUC**, **Classification Report**, and **Confusion Matrix**.

## 🖥️ UI Features (Streamlit)
| Tab | Description |
|---|---|
| 👤 Single Borrower | Input borrower details via sliders/dropdowns → get risk score, probability & badge |
| 📂 Batch CSV Upload | Upload CSV → predict all rows → download results |
| 📊 Model Performance | View accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, feature plots |

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy** — Overall correct predictions
- **ROC-AUC** — Ability to discriminate defaults from non-defaults
- **Confusion Matrix** — TP, FP, TN, FN breakdown
- **Classification Report** — Precision, Recall, F1-score per class

---

## ⚠️ Key Design Decisions
- **Outlier removal**: age capped at 80, employment experience at 50 yrs, income at 99th percentile
- **No data leakage**: scaler fitted only on training set, applied to test set
- **Stratified split**: maintains class ratio across train and test
- **Prediction Consistency**: Kept class weights default so Logistic Regression maintains calibrated probability outputs compared to Decision Tree.
